### What iteration did you complete?

Iteration 0

### How far into the iteration you were in progress on were you? Be specific.

I was about 15 minutes into iteration 1. I was sort of in the conceptualizing phase, as I'm still kind of soaking in all of the functions of Javascript. Most of the javascript in the file now is me trying a few different things but I think I need to look at this feature from a slightly different angle than some of my previous projects.

### What was most challenging about this for you?

The positioning was causing me a lot of problems. In the left container I was trying to get my flex properties working but it took forever for me to just get things centered. I was trying to add a flex property to the container and then align the content of the div but for some reason it only worked on the top text box and button, so I had to add auto margins to my 8-ball and a left margin to the clear button. It was challenging because I wanted to just center everything and then push the clear button to the right in its CSS class - sounds simple - but I probably spent an hour or an hour and a half just working on this.
